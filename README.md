# Test-Americor Task Results
Thank you for reviewing the task results. 

## Questions/Inconsistencies
During the execution process, some questions/inconsistencies identified that I would clarify with the team/client in a real situation, for example:

  1. The task stated that csv files were uploaded, but in reality they are xlsx files.
  2. In the 2nd exercise, it is unclear whether the top 3 action changes are for each month or for the entire period of activity. I assumed that this applies to each month and obtained the corresponding data for both months.
  3. In the 4th exercise, inconsistencies were found in the source data, including the absence of employees in the "user_team" table. It is unclear why some records contain empty values in the "updated_at" column, as well as how to find out when a new employee joined the team. I resolved this issue by assuming that employees with empty "updated_at" values came before 12/14/2019 and the data is up-to-date. I would like to get your opinion on this and clarify what to do with the missing data.
  4. It looks like there is no permission to read the folder and the files in it using the Google API. So I copied the folder to my Google Drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fQNzHY4t3eta0-eFlKl-VTpzTSESksV5 and gave my service account read access. I hope this won't be an obstacle to accepting the task. 
Note: In addition to each task, an excel table export was made. The files are named result_ex_1 to result_ex_4.xlsx.

## Exercise 1
Got a table that contains a list of staff members for the top 3 most frequent new values in the customer_action table (16 - Ready To Pitch, 3 - Nurtured, and 0 - Lead New) and corresponding metrics.

## Exercise 2
Got a table that contains the top 3 action changes made by each department each month and corresponding metrics (see the assumptions made above)
See two tables/sheets for both customer and customer_creditor action tables separately.

## Exercise 3
Got a table and a bar chart that show the 3-top most recent client statuses, as of 12/14/2020, from customer_action table for user 4462.

## Exercise 4
Got a table and a bar chart that show each sales team headcount as of 12/14/2019.
