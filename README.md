# Test-Americor Task Results
Thank you for reviewing the task results. 
During the execution process, some questions/mismatches arose that I would clarify with the team/client in a real situation.

## Questions/Inconsistencies
Here are some of the questions/inconsistencies identified:

1. The task stated that csv files were uploaded, but in reality they are xlsx files.
2. In the second exercise, it is unclear whether the top 3 action changes are for each month or for the entire period of activity. I assumed that this applies to each month and obtained the corresponding data for both months.
3. In the fourth exercise, inconsistencies were found in the source data, including the absence of employees in the "user_team" table. It is unclear why some records contain empty values in the "updated_at" column, as well as how to find out when a new employee joined the team. I resolved this issue by assuming that employees with empty "updated_at" values came before 12/14/2019 and the data is up-to-date. I would like to get your opinion on this and clarify what to do with the missing data.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me in a convenient format. I am always ready to discuss any issues and solve all problems together.
### Thank you!
