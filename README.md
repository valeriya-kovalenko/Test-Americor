# Test-Americor Task Results
Thank you for reviewing the task results. 

## Questions/Inconsistencies
During the execution process, some questions/inconsistencies identified that I would clarify with the team/client in a real situation, for example:

  1. The task stated that csv files were uploaded, but in reality they are xlsx files.
  2. In the 2nd exercise, it is unclear whether the top 3 action changes are for each month or for the entire period of activity. I assumed that this applies to each month and obtained the corresponding data for both months.
  3. In the 4th exercise, inconsistencies were found in the source data, including the absence of employees in the "user_team" table. It is unclear why some records contain empty values in the "updated_at" column, as well as how to find out when a new employee joined the team. I resolved this issue by assuming that employees with empty "updated_at" values came before 12/14/2019 and the data is up-to-date. I would like to get your opinion on this and clarify what to do with the missing data.

## Exercise 1
Attached is the file exercice_1.xlsx, exported using Python code. 
The file contains a list of staff members for the top 3 most frequent new values in the customer_action table (16 - Ready To Pitch, 3 - Nurtured, and 0 - Lead New) and corresponding metrics.

## Exercise 2
Attached is the file exercice_2.xlsx, exported using Python code. See two sheets for both customer and customer_creditor action tables separately.
The file contains the top 3 action changes made by each department each month and corresponding metrics (see the assumptions made above).

## Exercise 3
Attached is the file exercice_3.xlsx, exported using Python code.
The file contains the most recent client statuses, as of 12/14/2020, from customer_action table for staff member 4462.

## Exercise 4
Attached is the file exercice_4.xlsx, exported using Python code. 
As well as see results in a google sheet with the API https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u5vCLZlnNS1JRI5dV57KFTA38YOKJAoCncoMv3c-F9A/edit#gid=0
The files contain each sales team headcount as of 12/14/2019.
